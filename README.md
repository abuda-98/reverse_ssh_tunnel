## Overview

Reverse SSH tunneling is a method to connect back to a local machine from a remote server. This technique is useful in scenarios where the local machine is behind a firewall or NAT. By establishing a reverse SSH tunnel, you can bypass these restrictions and securely access services.

## Features

- **Secure Connection**: All data transmitted through the tunnel is encrypted.
- **Easy Setup**: Minimal configuration is required to get started.
- **Flexibility**: Works with various SSH clients and servers.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

To install the Reverse SSH Tunnel, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abuda-98/reverse_ssh_tunnel.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd reverse_ssh_tunnel
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x reverse_ssh_tunnel.sh
   ```

4. Ensure you have SSH installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install openssh-client
   ```

## Usage

To use the Reverse SSH Tunnel, execute the script with the appropriate parameters. The basic syntax is as follows:

```bash
./reverse_ssh_tunnel.sh [local_port] [remote_user] [remote_host] [remote_port]
```

### Parameters

- **local_port**: The port on your local machine that you want to forward.
- **remote_user**: The username for the remote server.
- **remote_host**: The IP address or hostname of the remote server.
- **remote_port**: The port on the remote server that you want to connect to.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the Reverse SSH Tunnel:

### Example 1: Forwarding a Local Web Server

If you have a web server running on your local machine on port 8080 and you want to access it from a remote server:

```bash
./reverse_ssh_tunnel.sh 8080 user@remote_host 8080
```

### Example 2: Accessing a Database

To access a database running on your local machine:

```bash
./reverse_ssh_tunnel.sh 3306 user@remote_host 3306
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following:

- **SSH Access**: Ensure you can SSH into the remote server without issues.
- **Firewall Settings**: Check if the firewall on the remote server allows incoming connections on the specified port.
- **Network Configuration**: Verify your local network settings to ensure that the local port is open and accessible.
